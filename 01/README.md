# Day 2

Same approach as in the first day. I noticed that i checked first winning conditions wrong
so ended up recieving wrong answer quite long. Then i read from reddit
what i did wrong and that solved my problem. Not the beautiest lines of code, but it works.

I use ord() function to recieve Unicode value in decimal from
character. Code would be more readable, if numbers have
names in this context.

"The ord() function returns the number representing the unicode code of a specified character."
